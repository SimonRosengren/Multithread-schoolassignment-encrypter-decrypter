# Multithread-schoolassignment-encrypter-decrypter
A school assignment in multi threaded programming C#
where I have created a simple program that encrypts and decrypts
a txt-file using three threads and a reader/writer design.

Mutual exclusion and syncronization is handled by
1 Mutex and 4 Semaphores.
